The Crypto Working Group meets around four times a year to present work to each other. It is a collaboration between several Dutch universities.

When I make slides, I support my spoken text with pictures. The lack of text on the slides is suboptimal for publishing them, but it is better than nothing 😉. If you want to get a global idea of what the paper is about I would advise looking [here](/talks2025/summerschool/).
