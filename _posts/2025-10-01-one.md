The ONE Conference is Europe’s prime cybersecurity event. A leading platform for sharing knowledge, best practices and research results.

Together with the [Young Talents](/projects/young_talents/) I pitched our project at the Main stage of the One Conference, and we had a presentation on the second day of the conference.
