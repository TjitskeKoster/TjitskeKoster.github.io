Together with my colleague Maarten we organize lunches for PhD's and Postdocs. We want to provid these young researches with a safe space to talk about research/ supervision/ etc.
The topics we have discussed are:

- Supervision
- Connecting with fellow PhDs/Postdocs
- Handling stress for paper deadlines
- Celebrating successes and dealing with rejections
- Collaborations
