The Young Talents in Cybersecurity 2025 program was an initiative of the Institut français-NL, the Embassy of France in the Netherlands, the Dutch Embassy in France, and the Franco-Dutch Network. The Young Talents program promotes collaboration and provides opportunities for the next generation of cybersecurity experts. The program's goal was to tackle new challenges and build bridges between academia, the private sector, and policymakers.

Together with 11 talented master's and PhD students from France and the Netherlands, I was selected for this program. We were divided into two teams and asked, "What will the next challenge in cybersecurity be?" 

We believe that the threat posed by a quantum computer to current cryptography will be the next challenge. So, we researched how organizations are preparing for the post-quantum era. We engaged with 62 organizations and conducted a survey.

This program started at the InCyber Forum in Lille on April 2, 2025, and "ended" at the ONE Conference in Den Haag on October 1, 2025. At both conferences, we got the time to introduce/ present our research. 

After the ONE Conference, our work did not come to an end. We wrote a report and may want to take this research further. Please stay in touch! 

🎥 I got the chance to speak at the opening of the ONE conference! You can find me [here](https://youtu.be/U9u1EGIO-D4?t=2356) and the introduction of the project a bit earlier [here](https://youtu.be/U9u1EGIO-D4?t=2275)
