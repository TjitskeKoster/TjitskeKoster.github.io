I was a guest on the Dutch podcast [All the Cyber Ladies](https://www.allthecyberladies.nl). We discussed post-quantum cryptography and the research of the [Young Talents](/projects/Young_Talents) on post-quantum cryptography.

During the podcast, we discussed how quantum computers could break existing security systems and why new encryption methods are urgently needed. I also share my experiences as a young woman navigating the worlds of cybersecurity and academia.

The episode offers listeners an accessible look at a complex technical topic, highlighting both innovation and diversity in the cyber realm.

All the Cyber Ladies is a Dutch-language podcast focused on women in the IT and cybersecurity sectors. Each episode features a “cyber lady” who shares her career journey, questions, achievements, and challenges in the field. Topics range widely — from ethics, politics, and public-private partnerships to legal aspects of cyber, drones, awareness, gaming, hacking, and more. The podcast is an initiative by content creator and host Lucinda Sterk. The episode featuring me is available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6aV706HANV92xhvbJUP7wC?si=a5a6a3e9a30343c1&nd=1&dlsi=8bad2eb7c6ee4b7b) and other podcast platforms (in Dutch only).
