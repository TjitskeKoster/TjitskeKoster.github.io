During the sixth edition of the Cyber Women Awards, I was honored with the “Cyber Women Student – wold" award. The ceremony was organized by [CEFCYS](https://cyberwomenday-cefcys.com/en/) (Cercle des Femmes de la CyberSécurité), the French Cyber Women Association. CEFCYS’s mission is to promote women in the field of cybersecurity.

I received the award for my active role in organizing PhD and Postdoc [lunches](/projects/lunches) within the Software Technology and Intelligent Systems departments of the TU Delft, as well as for my participation in the [Young Talents Cybersecurity](/projects/young_talents) project.
